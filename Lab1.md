# Logging into your CSE 15L account
This tutorial will cover how to use ssh to log into your course-specific account on `ieng6`. It will be divided up into 3 steps:

 -  Installing VScode
-   Remotely Connecting
-   Trying Some Commands
## Installing VScode
First, we are going to install VScode. The overall installation instructions can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs), and Windows-specific instructions (since I use Windows), can be found [here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows) All you need to do is download the Windows installer and run it. If everything is set up properly, you should be able to open VScode and have it look something like the screenshot below.
