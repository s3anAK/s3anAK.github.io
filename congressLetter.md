# Writing a Letter to Congress
[Here](https://s3anak.github.io/project3Final.pdf) is a sample letter to a congressman Ro Khanna about the climate crisis. Following are few tips and things that I learned while writing this letter that could help you in the future.


 - Be Formal
	 - I don't like formal writing/formatting because I think it comes off as pretentious sometimes, but in this case it's a really good idea. Congresspeople get hundreds of letters every day from all kinds of concerned citizens, so making sure that your letter is formal is a good way to stand out. It also helps you appear serious; these are people with the power to change our country, so you want to show them that you are not just sending a letter casually.
	 - Some ways to make a letter more formal are including your name/address, their name/address, addressing the letter to "honorable [congressperson]", and signing the letter at the end.
- Focus on one specific issue and action
	- My concern was generally about the climate crisis, but in order to have the most impact, it's important to focus on one specific issue or aspect of your larger concern. For me, that meant the proposed Willow Project. This carries more weight because it is easy for the congressperson to see your exact point and not overcomplicate things. If you can give them a specific action to take about your issue, that's even better because that simplifies it even further. They don't have time to try to read in between the lines and figure out your hidden meaning.
- Be personal
	- It helps to focus on some aspect of the issue that pertains to you specifically. This generally means that it has more impact if you write to your representative, as opposed to a random one (though it still would carry some impact). For me, this also meant focusing on my identity as a college student and how the climate has an outsized impact on my generation because we will be living through whatever environment older generations leave us. 
 - Use Facts and Figures
	 - Part of convincing the congressperson to make a change is to present them with hard evidence about why they should take some action. Bringing in specific pieces of information from studies or other sources are a good way to quantify your concern and show that there are other sources that back up your points.
 - Use a template
	 - Once the letter is written, it's important to make it look official. The way I did this was by using a template written in LaTeX, a styling language used for formal documents. The template I used was [this one.](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/thin-formal-letter) LaTeX can get pretty complicated quickly, but with the template all I had to was replace the sample information with my personal information and it formatted it nicely.
