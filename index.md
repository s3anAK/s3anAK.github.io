Hey there! I'm Sean King and I'm a sophomore at UC San Diego studying Computer Science.

I'm passionate about using computer science to solve real world problems, particularly those relating to the natural world. To that end, I am interested in GIS, maps, and scientific applications of computer science. A copy of my resumse is [here](https://s3anak.github.io/finalResume.pdf).

Outside of computing, I spend most of my time outdoors and in nature; I love rock climbing, mountaineering, trail running, backpacking, biking, and anything that involves the mountains. The photo above is from atop the 13,714' Mount Corcoran midway through a 15-hour day in the High Sierra.

## Work Experience:

*   I interned for 2 summers at [Caltopo](https://caltopo.com/about/) helping to develop mapping technologies to benefit first responders and recreational backcountry enthusiasts alike.
    *   In the summer of 2020, I built a Geology Overlay which is viewable [here](https://caltopo.com/m/0RDSP).
    *   In the summer of 2021, I worked on multiple projects for Caltopo.
        *   I rendered and imported Switzerland's topographic maps to Caltopo's database. An example based around Zermatt is viewable [here](https://caltopo.com/m/7S48A).
        *   I imported and used OpenStreetMap data to create overlays that display skiing and mountain biking routes. An example around Truckee, CA is viewableÂ [here](https://caltopo.com/m/989D9). Note that to change from mountain biking you must select "Ski" from the menu on the right. A legend is available at the bottom of the page.
        *   I added additional labels to Caltopo's flagship basemap, "MapBuilderTopo", to display town names, toilets, campgrounds, campsites, fences, and passes. An example of several of the icons around Whitney Portal, CA is viewable [here](https://caltopo.com/m/ELC9T).
* Technologies used/learned: Python, Shell Scripting, PostGIS, GDAl, Mapnik, SQL, Linux, Git/Github

## Personal Projects:

*   In the summer of 2022, I built a permit checker for backpacking permits in the Inyo National Forest. It can be used either to do bulk searches on all available permits or to check for last minute cancellations of hard-to-get-permits. It is viewable [here](https://github.com/s3anAK/recreation-gov-availability).
    * Technologies used/learned: Python, CRUD, AWS, Shell Scripting, working with APIs, Git/Github
*   I was selected as to participate in a highly competitive program (16% acceptance rate) as part of UCSD's ACM
quarterly projects. I am currently working on a project team to developing a website built in the MERN stack to
provide UCSD food recommendations based on the user's dietary preferences. I am mainly responsible for
developing a Restful API to access our MongoDB database of food options at UCSD While it is not deployed yet, the github repo is available [here](https://github.com/acmucsd-projects/fa22-hack-team-2). 
    * Technologies used/learned: Javascript, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node.js, React, Git/Github
